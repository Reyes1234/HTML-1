date input, and "birthday"
Javascript will read the date and print out age of user
need the "input" element, which can be give a "type" attribute
of "name" or "date"

Part 2.
Use Javascript to remove images as they are being clicked
DOM commands will be useful here
"node" variable, "node.parentNode" will give you the parent node
Once there's a parent node you can call "parent.removeChild(node)"
